## Ingredients

### Dough
- 1 cup milk
- 1/4 cup plus 1 tsp. granulated sugar, divided
- 1 packet (or 2 1/4 tsp.) active dry yeast
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 6 tbsp melted butter
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- Canola or vegetable oil, for frying

### Glaze
- 1/4 cup milk
- 2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract


## Directions

1. In a small, microwave-safe container, add the 1 cup milk. Microwave until lukewarm, about 40 seconds. Add the divided 1 tsp of sugar and stir to dissolve, then sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the 4 cups flour and 1/2 tsp salt.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 6 tbsp butter, 2 eggs, and 1/2 tsp vanilla with a wooden spoon.
4. Pour in yeast mixture, mix to combine, then add in dry ingredients (flour and salt). stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
5. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until elastic and only slightly tacky, adding more flour a teaspoon at a time if needed, about 5 minutes.
6. Form into a tight ball then place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a clean dish towel.
7. Let dough rise in a warm spot in your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
8. Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Punch down dough, then turn onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out into a ½ inch thick rectangle.
9. Using a doughnut cutter (or 3 inch and 1 inch biscuit cutters), punch out your doughnuts.
10. Re-knead scraps together and punch out as well.
11. Place doughnuts and holes onto baking sheets, cover with dish towel, and let rise again, about 40 minutes more.

### While waiting for the 2nd rise, you can make the glaze

1. In a large bowl, whisk together milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Set aside.

### Fry donuts

1. Line a large baking sheet with paper towels.
2. In a large dutch oven over medium heat, heat 2 inches of oil to 350°F.
3. Cook doughnuts, in batches, until deeply golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side. (Holes will cook even faster!)
4. Transfer doughnuts to paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain and cool slightly. Dip into glaze, then place onto a cooling rack (or eat immediately!)
